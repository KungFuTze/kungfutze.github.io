# MITxPRO Portfolio
This repository compiles all of the projects we have worked on as part of the MERN Fullstack software developement bootcamp by MITxPRO. 

# Useage
Cloning the repo and opening the index.html file in a browser or in VS code with the Live Server extension will run the program. 



# Roadmap
Future versions of this Portofolio will include other projects in other programming languages such as c++ and other technologies used in DEVOPS. As well as an updated resume.
